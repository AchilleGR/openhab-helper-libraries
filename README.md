# OpenHAB Helper Libraries

This is a fork of tamtam1111's fork of Ivan's Helper Libraries. The directory watcher has been repaired, so at least my jsr223 scripts are now hot-reloading again.

The original community libraries, script examples, and docs are included, but are not being maintained at the moment.

## Install

```bash
wget 'https://github.com/MiningMarsh/openhab-helper-libraries/archive/main.zip'
unzip main.zip
cp -r main/* /etc/openhab/conf/
```
